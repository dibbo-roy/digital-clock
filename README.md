# Digital Clock

I created this digital clock as a surprise for my girlfriend using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is my second web project, and I am excited to share it with you!

# How to Use

To use the digital clock, simply open the "index.html" file in your web browser. The current time will be displayed in a sleek, modern font, and the seconds will tick by in real time.

# Customization

If you would like to customize the clock, you can do so by editing the CSS file. You can change the font, color, and size of the clock to suit your preferences. If you are comfortable with JavaScript, you can also modify the code to add additional features or functionality.

# Future Improvements

I am always looking for ways to improve my projects, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. In the future, I may add additional features to the clock or create other web projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Thank you for checking out my digital clock!
